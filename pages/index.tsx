            <strong>Feedback Gathering:</strong> Since then, I've spoken to potential users to get feedback and gauge interest. I set up a waiting list and started collecting emails from early adopters while brainstorming marketing strategies and use cases.

            <br/>

<strong>Deep into what makes great videos:</strong> I've always been interested in content creation. I started a tech tips and tricks centered YouTube channel and Facebook page with thousands of followers when I was just 15, without much knowledge but with a strong desire to create. I stopped for a while and moved on to other things, but I never lost that passion. This time, I went down a rabbit hole to discover what makes a great video, especially on YouTube, from the best in the field, such as Mr. Beast, Colin and Samir, Yon Youshaei, and even smaller, faceless channels. I didn't stop with just learning; I got my hands dirty by practicing and creating prompts, processes, Notion templates, advanced animation, and editing. I created multiple channels and trained a team, and you can find a sample video here. I gathered hands-on insights that will directly translate into our product.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>All in on AI:</strong> I've played with every open-source LLMS on the Hugging Face leaderboard, trending AI GitHub tools, AI news content from Lex Fridman guests to hobbyists trying to set up a cozy UI on free Colab, proprietary and rag systems, AI agents, AI images, videos, 3D models, advanced prompt engineering, and so on. I integrated AI workflows into my daily life, creating all sorts of personal assistants and side projects (AI autonomous website builders deployed +200 websites with one command, AI domain generators, etc.). This is revolutionary technology, and I'm all in.

I'm ready, and I'm giving my soul fully to this. I can't wait to integrate the latest models and insights I've gathered from all this time. Be ready; this will be a unique journey.
